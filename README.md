This can be seen in the sediments in the alternating layers of green and purple layers. The green indicate and anoxic and the purple is oxidized. The color variation is due to the iron in the sediment which in the presence of oxygen will \"rust\" the iron and it shows up as purple in the sediments. \n\nIt was in this layer and this location that the first dinosaurs were discovered by Arthur Lakes, a teacher from Golden, CO.",
